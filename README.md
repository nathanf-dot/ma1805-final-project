My project, "Digital Crown Shyness", is an interactive artwork that simulates an aerial view of a forest canopy inspired by the natural phenomenon crown shyness — where treetops grow close to one another but avoid touching, leaving visible gaps. The user interacts with the forest as if they were the wind, gently pushing trees apart and creating spacing between canopies. The work is a reflection on how natural behaviours can be translated into code, suggesting that digital environments can mimic — or reimagine — biological systems. Each tree is reduced to simple circles, yet collectively they behave as a forest, hinting at how complexity can arise from simple rules. The ever-changing background slideshow of real nature photography reinforces the connection between physical landscapes and computational space, positioning the sketch somewhere between organic world and digital simulation. The project questions how we observe nature once it becomes data, and how interactivity alters our role — from passive viewer to active atmospheric force. In this project I used my own photos I have taken in nature as the background for the project, I wanted to create a more intimate space in the project and question the gap between humanity, nature and the digital space even more. Similarly, I also used an original source for the wind sound generated upon clicking the cursor. The use of the "N" key to switch between day and night was more of a technical choice for the project as I felt this added a stylistic element to it. 

Prior to this projects I had limited coding knowledge aside from the mini-portfolio project earlier in the term and no experience working with graphics. In terms of technical issues I encountered, I had struggled with the original concept and although I had known what i had envisioned for the project, I seemingly couldn't wrap my head around how to bring the project to life, I struggled to see how I could make the trees look realistic, but eventually settled on a more abstract choice to represent the trees. Also I battled with making the interactions too strong/too subtle, I had to tune values like wind radius, lerp return speed and gust force to feel natural. Another issue I encountered was layering the background with the sketch itself, for which I had to make some adjustments in the HTML and also refamiliarise myself with the Z-index and how to utilise it.
